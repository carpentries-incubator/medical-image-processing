Large language model (LLM)
: A LLM is a type of AI model primarily defined by the size of its training data rather than its architecture. Initially, most LLMs were based on transformer architecture, but other types have since emerged. Multimodal LLMs can handle multiple types of input and output, such as text and images.

Positron emission tomography (PET)
: A PET scan involves the use of radioactive tracers, such as Fluorodeoxyglucose or Oxygen-15 (15O), which are administered to the patient. Gamma ray detectors then create an image based on the tracer's distribution in the body. PET scans can be combined with or registered to other forms of imaging for enhanced diagnostic accuracy.

Tag image file format (TIFF)
: TIFF files conform to the Tag Image File Format standard and can store grayscale or color images as raster images. They support both lossy and lossless compression, and can also be left uncompressed.
