Large language model (LLM)
:   A large language model is a type of AI model. At first most LLMs were based on a transformer architecture, but other types of models have emerged, therefore what truly defines them is not architecture but the size of the training data. Multimodal large language models can have more than one type of input or output e.g. text or images.

Positron emission tomography (PET)
:    A PET scan is one which uses one of several radioactive tracers e.g. Fluorodeoxyglucose or 
Oxygen-15 (15O) is administered to the patient, and then gamma ray detectors are used to create an image. PET scans can be acquired with and/or registered to other forms of imaging.
