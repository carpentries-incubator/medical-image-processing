Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)
: BIDS is a standardized way of organizing and describing neuroimaging and behavioral data. It aims to simplify data sharing and analysis by providing a consistent file structure and naming convention across different studies and institutions.

Computed tomography (CT)
: A CT scan uses X-rays and computer processing to create cross-sectional images of the body. Multiple X-ray measurements are taken from different angles to produce detailed slices that can be combined into three-dimensional representations, providing more comprehensive information than traditional X-rays.

Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
: DICOM is both a file format and a communication protocol standard for medical imaging. It allows for the integration of medical imaging devices, servers, workstations, printers, and network hardware from multiple manufacturers into a comprehensive information system.

Large language model (LLM)
: A LLM is a type of AI model primarily defined by the size of its training data rather than its architecture. Initially, most LLMs were based on transformer architecture, but other types have since emerged. Multimodal LLMs can handle multiple types of input and output, such as text and images.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
: MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate detailed images of organs and tissues. It's particularly useful for visualizing soft tissues and doesn't use ionizing radiation, making it suitable for repeated scans.

Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI)
: NIfTI is a file format commonly used in neuroimaging to store and share brain imaging data. It was developed to address limitations in previous formats and includes support for storing image orientation and other metadata crucial for accurate analysis.

Positron emission tomography (PET)
: A PET scan involves the use of radioactive tracers, such as Fluorodeoxyglucose or Oxygen-15 (15O), which are administered to the patient. Gamma ray detectors then create an image based on the tracer's distribution in the body. PET scans can be combined with or registered to other forms of imaging for enhanced diagnostic accuracy.

Radiomics
: Radiomics implies a quantitiative approach to medical image analysis. Quantitative features are extracted from medical images using data-characterization algorithms. These features, which may not be visible to the human eye, can potentially be used for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning.

Tag image file format (TIFF)
: TIFF files conform to the Tag Image File Format standard and can store grayscale or color images as raster images. They support both lossy and lossless compression, and can also be left uncompressed.
