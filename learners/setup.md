Setup instructions live in this document. 

## Data Sets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
Downloading the data will be done with the requests library as part of each lesson.

## Software Setup

### Details

Setup for different systems can be done slightly differently.
We reccomend using conda or mamba, but some of you, especially Linux
users may find it more convenient to build the environments by hand.
