Ayla from Cancer Center 

Ayla is an MD, PhD candidate from a major academic medical center's hematology department. She began working on data from pediatric thallesemia patients with the question of how the disease affects brain development. She was given tabular data on patient brain measurements, based on a lot of brain MRIs collected during the study of these patients, as well as age paired patients without thallesemia.  But these brain MRIs were collected from different institutions. She seeks to make sense of whether the tabular data produced makes sense, and remove any MRIs that were incorrectly acquired. Then she would like to use deep learning or machine learning to determine if thallesemia implies specific changes in the patient brains. She is unsure what to do about the different collection sites.  

Lenoard from Radiology

 
Lenoard, a dedicated PhD student at an academic medical center, is excited to dig deeper into the complexities of diagnostic image processing. He is particularly intrigued by the algorithmic complexities of image processing pipelines and seeks guidance on maximizing efficiency and scalability in handling large datasets. In addition, Lenoard is interested in exploring dimensionality reduction and image segmentation techniques, including recent advances and their practical implications. He is also interested in working with 3D meshes and wishes to learn the basics of synthetic image generation and resolution enhancement, despite his limited familiarity with medical imaging applications, which she is eager to understand better. 

Dahlia from Pathology 

Dahlia is a PhD candidate a major academic medical center in pathology. She wants to examine how hormone levels effect bones and bone strength. She has many CTs, where an algorithm performed opportunistic screening for osteoporosis by using vertebral body, but she seeks to understand the ties between the hormones and actual bone architecture. She wants to understand what radiometric parameters correlate to osteoporosis, so that a more explainable models can be built. 

Dan from Technical Medicine 

Dan is a postdoctoral research fellow in technical medicine working in at a major academic medical center. He is helping build a new pipeline for pediatric MRI volume measurement. This involves image registration to a pediatric brain atlas, but unfortunately no popular open tools do such a task on very young children. Dan must build the new tool which will segment then register pediatric brains to an existing atlas.
