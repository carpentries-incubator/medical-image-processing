## Introduction

In the realm of medical imaging analysis, registration and segmentation play crucial roles. Registration aligns images, enabling the fusion of data or the tracking of changes over time. Segmentation identifies and labels objects of interest within images. Automation is essential due to high clinical demand, driving the development of robust algorithms for both processes. Moreover, many advanced segmentation techniques utilize image registration, whether implicitly or explicitly.

[SimpleITK](https://github.com/SimpleITK/SimpleITK) (SITK) is a simplified programming interface to the algorithms and data structures of the [Insight Toolkit](https://itk.org/) (ITK) for segmentation, registration and advanced image analysis, available in many programming languages (e.g., C++, Python, R, Java, C#, Lua, Ruby).
