## Introduction

This is a lesson created in the style of The Carpentries. It is written with the assumption
that you already posess skills in terms of git, Python and basic image processing.

The interpretation of medical images for clinical purposes involves skills that take
highly trained professionals like nuclear medicine specialists and
radiologists many years to master. This course does not aim to improve such
interprative skills, rather to enhance the computational skills
needed to awnser research questions with medical images.

Some examples of the kinds of research questions that can be awnsered are:

- Can we predict from brain MRIs when patients will become demented before they do?

- Can we build machine learning models on ultrasound data which can aid in the detection of neuromuscular diseases?

- Can we use existing medical imaging to screen for underdiagnosed conditions like osteoporosis?

You are in all likelyhood here because you have a research question which can be awnsered with
the processing and analysis of medical images. This course is meant to aid you.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections will be used to highlight information.

They are  used to emphasise particularly important points
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: code

## WHat will code look like?

What is the output of this command?

```python
paste("This", "new", "lesson", "looks", "good")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 
```output
[1] "This new lesson looks good"
```

## Lectures

Some of our episodes are based on presentations. Most episodes involve real useable code.

Not everyone uses all forms of medical images, but you can learn a lot even with image types you will not use.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use questions to challenge yourself
- This course is in development
- Lectures often provide materials not yet in the notes
