## Introduction

This is a lesson created in the style of [The Carpentries](https://datacarpentry.org/). It is written with the assumption
that you already possess skills in terms of git, Python and basic image processing.

The interpretation of medical images for clinical purposes requires skills that take
highly trained professionals such as nuclear medicine specialists and
radiologists many years to master. This course does not aim to improve such
interpretive skills, but rather to enhance the computational skills
needed to answer research questions involving medical images.

Some examples of the kinds of research questions that can be answered are:

- Can we predict from brain MRIs when patients will become demented before they do?

- Can we build machine learning models on ultrasound data which can aid in the detection of neuromuscular diseases?

- Are there observable anatomical differences in the brains of autistic people at a population level? 

- Can we use existing medical imaging to screen for underdiagnosed conditions like osteoporosis?

You are in all likelihood here because you have a research question which can be answered with
the processing and analysis of medical images. This course is meant to aid you.
